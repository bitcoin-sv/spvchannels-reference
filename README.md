# SPV Channels CE

This repository contains SPV Channels Community Edition, which implements the BRFC specification for SPV channels.
In addition to server side implementation, it also contains JavaScript client libraries for interacting with the server. See [Client libraries readme](client/javascript/readme.md) for more details about the client side libraries. 

SPV Channels provides a mechanism via which counterparties can communicate in a secure manner even in circumstances where one of the parties is temporarily offline.

# Deploying SPV Channels CE API Server as docker containers on Linux

## Pre Requirements:
A SSL server certificate is required for installation. You can obtain the certificate from your IT support team. There are are also services that issue free SSL certificates such as letsencrypt.org.  The certificate must be issued for the host with fully qualified domain name. To use the server side certificate, you need to export it (including the corresponding private key) in PFX file format (*.pfx).

API Clients must trust the Certification Authority (CA) that issued server side SSL certificate.

## Initial setup

For running in a production environment, you should use Docker.

1.	Open the terminal.

2. Create a directory where the spvchannels docker images, config and database will be stored (e.g. spvchannels) and navigate to it.

    ```
    mkdir spvchannels
    cd spvchannels
    ```    
   
3. Download the distribution of SPV Channels Server into the directory created in the previous step and extract the contents.

4. Check that the following files are present:

     - `docker-compose.yml`
     - `.env`
     
5. Create a config folder and save the SSL server certificate file (<certificate_file_name>.pfx) into the config folder. This server certificate is required to setup TLS (SSL).

6.	Before running the SPV Channels API Server containers (spvchannels-db and spvchannels), you must configure or replace some values in the `.env` file.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|CERTIFICATE_FILENAME_VALUE|Fully qualified file name of the SSL server certificate (e.g. *<certificate_file_name.pfx>*) copied in step 5.|
|CERTIFICATES_PASSWORD_VALUE|The password of the *.pfx file copied in step 5.|
   > **Note:** The remaining setting are explaned in section [Settings](#Settings).

## Running application
1. After everything is set up and configured correctly, you can launch the spvchannels-db and spvchannels containers using the following command:

    ```
    docker-compose up â€“d
    ```

The docker images are automatically pulled from Docker Hub. 

2. Finally you can verify that all the SPV Channels Server containers are running (bitcoinsv/spvchannels-db and bitcoinsv/spvchannels) using:

    ```
    docker ps
    ```
   
3. If everything is running you can continue to section [Account manager](#Account-manager:) to create an account.

> **Note:** If you were provided with an account id and its credentials then you can skip Setting up an account and proceed to [REST interface](#REST-interface)

## Setting up an account
To be able to call SPV Channels Server API, an account must be added into the database using the following command:

   ```
   docker exec spvchannels ./SPVChannels.API.Rest -createaccount [accountname] [username] [password]
   ```

Parameter description:

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [accountname] | name of the account, any whitespaces in accountname must be replaced with '_' |
| [username] | username of the account |
| [password] | password of the username |

   > **Note:** This command can also be used to add new users to an existing account (e.g. running `docker exec spvchannels ./SPVChannels.API.Rest -createaccount Accountname User1 OtherP@ssword` will return the account-id of Accountname).

## REST interface

The reference implementation exposes different **REST APIs**:

* an API for managing channels
* an API for managing messages

This interfaces can be accessed on `https://<servername>:<port>/api/v1`. A Swagger page with the interface description can be accessed at `https://<servername>:<port>/swagger/index.html`
> **Note:** `<servername>` should be replaced with the name of the server where docker is running. `<port>` is set to 5010 by default in the `.env` file.

## Settings
| Parameter | Data type (allowed value) | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| NPGSQLLOGMANAGER | `<bool>` (`True|False`) | Enables additional database logging. Logs are in the spvchannels-db container and can be accessed with the command (docker logs spvchannels-db). By defaulte it's set to `False`. |
| HTTPSPORT | `<number>` | Port number on which the SPV Channels API is running. By default it's set to `5010`. |
| CERTIFICATEFILENAME | `<text>` | Fully qualified file name of the SSL server certificate (e.g. *<certificate_file_name.pfx>*) |
| CERTIFICATESPASSWORD | `<text>` | Password of the *.pfx file |
| NOTIFICATIONTEXTNEWMESSAGE | `<text>` | Notification text upon arrival of a new message. By default it's set to `New message arrived`. |
| MAXMESSAGECONTENTLENGTH | `<number>` | The maximum size of any single message in bytes. By default it's set to its maximum size `65536`. |
| CHUNKEDBUFFERSIZE | `<number>` | If a message is sent in chunks, this sets the size of a chunk. By default it's set to `1024`. |
| TOKENSIZE | `<number>` | Length of bearer token. By default it's set to `64`. |
| CACHESIZE | `<number>` | Number of records in memorycache. By default it's set to `1048576`. |
| CACHESLIDINGEXPIRATIONTIME | `<number>` | Time in which a record is removed from memorycache if it is not accessed. By default it's set to `60` seconds. |
| CACHEABSOLUTEEXPIRATIONTIME | `<number>` | Time in which a record is removed from memorycache. By defaulte it's set to `600` seconds. |

## Terminating application

1. Open the terminal and navigate to spvchannels folder:

    ```
    cd spvchannels
    ```

2. To shutdown SPV Channels Server containers you run the following command:

    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```
